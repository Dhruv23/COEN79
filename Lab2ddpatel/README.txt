Do these first:
1. type "make" and see everything compile and some executables linked.
2. rename the directory to "lab2<your ID>".  (No doubel-quotes, <your ID> is
your email without the "@scu.edu" part, or the group name.)
3. edit all .h, *.cxx, and Makefile to replace the header with your ID and email
4. Replace "namespace coen79" to "namespace lab2<your ID>.  Find all the "using" in every files and do the same.


This is sample code.  They compile, but does not work.  You need to replace or fill-in most
of them.   You can also ignore all these and do your lab from scratch.

Before you start, understand the objectives of the lab.  Write a "test plan" that ensure
thsoe objectives will be met.  You can discuss this with a partner.

Then, I suggest you start with "card.h, card.cxx, cardmain.cxx" first.  With those done, you can "make
cardtest" and test that out.  Go back to your test plan and see if the objectives for this
part are met.

Then do "deck.h, deck.cxx, and deckmain.cxx".  Same as above.

Think about how you are going to do poker before you start.  Have a plan and code/test
incrementally.
