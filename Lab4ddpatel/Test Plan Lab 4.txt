* Test roster by creating a roster and adding a default student to it //works 
* Test roster by adding muptliple users (3) and test begin, next, and end //works
* Test the provided code (from camino) with my implementation //works
* My output in output_file is as expected //works
* Test that the capacity increases when the thing is maxed //works
